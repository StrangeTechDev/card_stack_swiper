This is a Flutter package for a Stack card swiper. ✨

It allows you to swipe left, right, up, and down and define your own business logic for each direction. It features smooth animations and supports Android, iOS.

## Why?

We built this package because we wanted to:

-   Have a fully customizable slider
-   Swipe in any direction
-   Undo swipes as many times as you want
-   Choose your own settings such as duration, angle, offsets and more
-   Trigger swipes programmatically with a controller
-   Add callbacks for swipe, undo, on end, or when the swiper is disabled
-   Detect the real-time swipe direction

```

## Usage

Here is a basic example of how to use the `CardStackSwiper`.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:card_stack_swiper/card_stack_swiper.dart';

class ExamplePage extends StatefulWidget {
  const ExamplePage({super.key});

  @override
  State<ExamplePage> createState() => _ExamplePageState();
}

class _ExamplePageState extends State<ExamplePage> {
  final CardStackSwiperController _controller = CardStackSwiperController();

  final List<Widget> _cards = [
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
      Card(
        elevation: 4,
        shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20)),
        color: Colors.primaries[i % Colors.primaries.length].shade300,
        child: Center(child: Text('Card ${i + 1}', style: const TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white))),
      )
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('CardStackSwiper Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            SizedBox(
              width: 300,
              height: 400,
              child: CardStackSwiper(
                controller: _controller,
                cardsCount: _cards.length,
                initialIndex: 0,
                isLoop: true,
                onSwipe: (previousIndex, currentIndex, direction) {
                  debugPrint('Swiped from $previousIndex to $currentIndex in $direction direction');
                  return true;
                },
                onEnd: () {
                  debugPrint('Reached end of the stack');
                },
                cardBuilder: (context, index, horizontalPercentage, verticalPercentage) {
                  return _cards[index];
                },
              ),
            ),
            const SizedBox(height: 20),
            Row(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                IconButton(
                  icon: const Icon(Icons.undo),
                  onPressed: _controller.undo,
                ),
                IconButton(
                  icon: const Icon(Icons.arrow_forward),
                  onPressed: () => _controller.swipe(CardStackSwiperDirection.right),
                ),
              ],
            )
          ],
