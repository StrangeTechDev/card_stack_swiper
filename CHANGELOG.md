## [1.1.2]

### Fixed

- Fixed stacked preview depth when the swiper has only **two cards**. Previously, the widget always built a four-layer stack (top card plus three back layers). With `cardsCount: 2` and `isLoop: true`, the same card could appear multiple times in the stack, which looked like duplicate previews behind the front card.
- Stack depth and card settings now adapt to `cardsCount`: one card shows only the top layer; two cards show two visible previews plus a hidden slot used for smooth loop transitions; three or more cards keep the original four-layer behavior.
- Contributed by [@zeewell](https://github.com/zeewell) in [#1](https://github.com/Politanskyi/card_stack_swiper/pull/1). Thank you for the fix and the regression tests!

### Added

- Regression test ensuring only two stack cards are visible when `cardsCount` is 2.
- Updated loop-mode widget tests to assert visible card count instead of duplicate widget instances.

## [1.1.1]

### Added
- `emptyCardBuilder` parameter to display custom widget when all cards are swiped and `isLoop` is false
- `CardStackSwiperEmptyCardBuilder` typedef for building empty state widget
- Smooth animated transition between card stack and empty state using `AnimatedSwitcher`
- Comprehensive test suite with 45 tests covering all plugin functionality
- Unit tests for `Undoable` utility class
- Unit tests for `AllowedSwipeDirection` configuration class
- Unit and widget tests for `CardStackSwiperController`
- Widget tests for main `CardStackSwiper` functionality
- Test helpers for card building, finders, gestures, and app pumping
- Tests for new `emptyCardBuilder` functionality

### Changed
- Updated `_allCardsSwiped` logic to properly handle `null` index state
- Modified `didUpdateWidget` logic to preserve index state when `emptyCardBuilder` is used
- Improved state management for end-of-stack scenarios
- Refactored `CardStackSwiperContent` widget to encapsulate `AnimatedSwitcher` logic
- Enhanced test coverage from basic functionality to comprehensive API testing
- Optimized test structure to work with CardStackSwiper's multi-card display architecture

### Fixed
- Fixed empty state not displaying when all cards are swiped with `isLoop` disabled
- Resolved index reset issue that prevented empty card builder from showing
- Fixed controller widget tests to use `pumpAndSettle()` for proper animation handling
- Corrected test assertions to handle CardStackSwiper's multiple card display structure
- Resolved lint warnings including unused variables and print statements
- Fixed test helper imports and gesture implementations
